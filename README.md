Produce code with the following functionality:

<ol>

 <li>Implement a circular doubly linked queue. Your queue needs to support adding new elements, return the element with the first element and removing the first element. Adding an element and removing the element with the highest element should be at most <strong>O(1)</strong> where N is the size of the queue. The queue should start with a capacity greater that 1. When the queue is full and another element is added the queue capacity should be doubled. If additions and deletions are intermixed it is possible that a large number additions can be done without increasing the capacity.</li>

 <li>Your queue needs to be able to hold process objects. A process has a name (String), an owner (String), PID (int), number of threads, percent of CPU currently being used and total amount of CPU time used.</li>

 <li>Programs that use your queue will want to display and print out the elements in the queue. They will need to display/print out the queue ordered by name, PID, CPU time used, percent of CPU time, total CPU time or by owner.</li>

</ol>

You are to write your own queue code. Do not use any existing queue library. Do not use any of your languages collection classes or related classes. Note you are not writing a program, you are writing code that will be used by programs.
